            Graduate Farmer is committed to revolutionizing poultry farming by
            offering 100% antibiotic-free chicken and eggs. Our journey began
            with a vision to provide healthier and more sustainable food options
            while empowering farmers. At Graduate Farmer, we produce
            azolla-based, herb-enriched poultry feed to ensure the highest
            quality and nutrition in our products. We work closely with farmers,
            providing them with chicks, natural feed, and training in
            antibiotic-free poultry farming. The farmers' produce is bought back
            and sold under our trusted brand, ensuring a seamless farm-to-table
            experience. Located in the heart of Barak Valley, Assam, we strive
            to create a healthier future for our customers and the environment.
